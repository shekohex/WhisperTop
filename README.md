# WhisperTop

**Your voice, anywhere.**

WhisperTop is an Android overlay application that enables quick and accurate speech-to-text transcription anywhere on your device. With a floating microphone button that works on top of any app, you can transcribe speech directly into text fields using your own OpenAI API key.

## Overview

WhisperTop provides seamless speech-to-text functionality through a system-wide overlay that doesn't interfere with your existing keyboard or input methods. The app uses OpenAI's Whisper API for high-quality transcription, supporting multiple models including Whisper 3 Turbo and GPT-4o.

**Key Benefits:**
- Works in any app without replacing your keyboard
- Privacy-first: uses your own OpenAI API key
- No data retention or logging
- Fast, accurate transcription with multi-language support
- Customizable floating interface

## Features

### Core Features
- **Floating Microphone Button**: Draggable overlay button accessible from any app
- **Intelligent Text Insertion**: Transcribed text automatically appears in active text fields with smart spacing
- **Text Replacement vs. Appending**: Replaces selected text or intelligently appends to existing content
- **OpenAI Integration**: Support for Whisper 3 Turbo, GPT-4o, and other transcription models
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic language detection or manual selection
- **Secure Storage**: API keys encrypted locally using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded states (idle, recording, processing) with animated indicators
- **Custom Endpoints**: Support for OpenAI-compatible transcription services
- **Transcription Customization**: Custom prompts and temperature control for improved accuracy
- **Clickable Permission Cards**: Intuitive onboarding with interactive permission requests

### Privacy & Security
- All transcription requests sent directly to OpenAI using your API key
- No audio files or transcriptions stored on device
- No third-party intermediaries or data sharing
- Complete control over your data and API usage

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher
- OpenAI API account with available credits
- Device with microphone access

### Download
1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/shekohex/WhisperTop/releases) page
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your device settings
3. Install the APK

### Required Permissions
WhisperTop requires the following permissions to function:

- **Microphone**: To capture audio for transcription
- **Display over other apps**: For the floating microphone button
- **Accessibility Service**: To insert transcribed text into active fields

You'll be prompted to grant these permissions during initial setup.

## Setup

### 1. API Configuration
1. Open WhisperTop and navigate to Settings
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. (Optional) Configure a custom endpoint if using an OpenAI-compatible service
4. Select your preferred transcription model:
   - Whisper 3 Turbo (faster, cost-effective)
   - GPT-4o (higher accuracy)
   - Custom model (manual entry)

### 2. Enable Overlay
1. Grant "Display over other apps" permission when prompted
2. The floating microphone button will appear on your screen
3. Drag it to your preferred position

### 3. Enable Accessibility Service
1. Go to Android Settings > Accessibility
2. Find "WhisperTop" in the list
3. Enable the accessibility service
4. This allows the app to insert transcribed text into active fields

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Start Recording**: Tap the floating microphone button
2. **Speak Clearly**: The button will show a pulsing animation while recording
3. **Stop Recording**: Tap the button again or wait for auto-stop
4. **Automatic Insertion**: Transcribed text appears in the currently focused text field

### Visual Indicators
- **Gray**: Idle state, ready to record
- **Red**: Actively recording audio
- **Blue**: Processing audio with OpenAI API
- **Green**: Successfully completed transcription

### Tips for Best Results
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Ensure good audio quality (minimal background noise)
- Position your device's microphone appropriately
- Use in quiet environments when possible

## Configuration Options

### API Settings
- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (stored securely)
- **Base URL**: Custom endpoint for OpenAI-compatible services
- **Model Selection**: Choose from available transcription models
- **Language**: Auto-detect or specify a target language

### Transcription Customization
- **Custom Prompt**: Provide context to improve transcription accuracy for domain-specific terms, names, or technical vocabulary (up to ~224 tokens)
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust transcription randomness:
  - **0.0-0.3**: More accurate and consistent results
  - **0.4-0.7**: Balanced approach 
  - **0.8-2.0**: More creative interpretations (may introduce variations)

These advanced settings allow you to fine-tune the OpenAI Whisper API behavior for your specific use case, improving accuracy for specialized vocabulary or adjusting the consistency of transcriptions.

### Interface Settings
- **Overlay Position**: Drag the button to your preferred location
- **Button Size**: Adjust overlay button size (future feature)
- **Theme Options**: Light/dark mode support (future feature)

## Development
