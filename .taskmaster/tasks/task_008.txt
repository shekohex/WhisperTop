# Description: Create accessibility service to paste transcribed text into focused input fields

Extend AccessibilityService with proper service configuration in XML. Implement findFocusedEditText() and insertText() methods using AccessibilityNodeInfo. Handle different input field types (EditText, WebView inputs, etc.). Add proper event filtering and node traversal. Implement fallback mechanisms using clipboard and global actions. Handle permission requests and service binding.
