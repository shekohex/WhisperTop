# Task ID: 62
# Title: Implement UI Polish and Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 20, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Add comprehensive UI polish with counter animations, smooth transitions, pull-to-refresh, loading states, error handling, haptic feedback, and accessibility improvements across all screens.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive UI polish using Compose Animation API with the following components: 1) Counter animations for statistics values using animateIntAsState and animateFloatAsState with easing curves. 2) Screen transitions using AnimatedContent with Material Motion slideIn/slideOut and fadeIn/fadeOut animations. 3) Pull-to-refresh with custom SwipeRefresh composable featuring bounce animations and loading indicators. 4) Loading states with skeleton components using Shimmer effects and placeholder animations. 5) Error states with retry buttons, custom illustrations, and slide-in animations for error messages. 6) Empty states with custom vector illustrations, animated onboarding hints, and action buttons. 7) Haptic feedback integration using HapticFeedbackType for button clicks, long presses, and success actions. 8) Micro-interactions including button press animations, card hover effects, ripple animations, and spring-based scaling. 9) Enhanced dark theme support with proper color mapping for all new animations and components. 10) Accessibility improvements including content descriptions, focus traversal order, semantic properties, and high contrast support. Use Material 3 motion tokens, ensure 60fps performance with remember() optimization, implement proper state management for animations, and create reusable animation modifiers. Test across multiple devices and screen densities.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for animation state management and timing calculations. Implement UI tests using ComposeTestRule to verify animation behavior, duration, and completion states. Test pull-to-refresh functionality with mock data loading scenarios. Verify skeleton loading states display correctly during data fetching. Test error state retry functionality and animation timing. Validate haptic feedback triggers on supported devices. Perform accessibility testing with TalkBack enabled to ensure content descriptions and focus order work correctly. Test dark/light theme transitions for all animated components. Measure performance using GPU profiler to ensure 60fps across all animations. Test on various screen sizes and orientations to verify responsive animation behavior.
