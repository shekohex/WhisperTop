# Task ID: 63
# Title: Implement User Preferences and Settings for Statistics Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 17, 48
# Priority: low
# Description: Create comprehensive user preferences system for statistics tracking, data management, and dashboard customization with encrypted storage and UI controls.
# Details:
Extend AppSettings data class to include new preference fields: statisticsEnabled (Boolean, default true), historyRetentionDays (Int, default 90), exportFormat (enum: JSON/CSV, default JSON), dashboardMetricsVisible (Set<String>, default all), chartTimeRange (enum: 7/14/30 days, default 14), notificationsEnabled (Boolean, default true), dataPrivacyMode (enum: FULL/ANONYMIZED/DISABLED, default FULL), and allowDataImport (Boolean, default true). Update PreferenceRepository to use EncryptedSharedPreferences for secure storage with AES-256 encryption. Implement preference migration logic using PreferenceMigrationHelper to handle version updates gracefully. Create SettingsPreferencesScreen composable with organized sections: Data Collection (statistics toggle, retention period slider with day indicators), Export & Import (format selection chips, import button with file picker), Dashboard (metric visibility checkboxes, chart range selection), Notifications (milestone alerts toggle, frequency selection), Privacy (data mode radio buttons, anonymization explanation), and Advanced (reset confirmation dialog, bulk data operations). Add validation logic for retention periods (7-365 days), export format compatibility checks, and data integrity verification for imports. Implement PreferencesViewModel extending BaseViewModel with proper state management, validation, and persistence operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for AppSettings validation including edge cases for retention periods and invalid enum values. Test PreferenceRepository encryption/decryption with EncryptedSharedPreferences mock. Implement preference migration tests with mock data across different versions. Test SettingsPreferencesScreen UI interactions including slider values, checkbox states, and dialog confirmations using ComposeTestRule. Verify settings persistence across app restarts and validate that changes immediately affect dependent features like statistics collection and dashboard display. Test import functionality with valid/invalid data files and export format generation accuracy.
