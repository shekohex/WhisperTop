Maintain existing >80% code coverage.

# Test Strategy:
Fix all failing tests to achieve 100% pass rate, maintain >80% code coverage, ensure all existing comprehensive tests continue working

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Dependency Injection Test Failures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve 12 failing tests related to DI configuration mismatches
### Details:
Investigate and fix interface mismatches in dependency injection setup causing test failures. Review Koin module configurations and ensure proper test module setup.

Looking at the user request, they've identified the specific missing test dependencies and configuration issues causing the test failures. This is comprehensive diagnostic information that should be added to track the investigation results and next steps.

**INVESTIGATION RESULTS:** Missing test dependencies identified as root cause of 50+ compilation errors:
- Robolectric missing for Android unit tests (causing unresolved reference errors)
- Compose UI testing libraries missing for @createComposeRule usage
- Mockito static mocking support incomplete
- Interface mismatch between Flow<T> and StateFlow<T> in OnboardingViewModelTest
- Platform-specific test dependencies not properly configured

**AFFECTED AREAS:** managers/, presentation/viewmodels/, ui/overlay/ packages (6 test files total)

**RESOLUTION PLAN:** Add missing dependencies to libs.versions.toml and build.gradle.kts files to resolve compilation errors before addressing interface mismatches.

PROGRESS UPDATE: Successful resolution of major compilation issues! Compilation errors reduced from 50+ to 0, with all Android unit tests now compiling successfully. 

RESOLVED ISSUES:
- Added missing test dependencies (Robolectric, Compose UI tests, Mockito)
- Fixed Flow vs StateFlow interface mismatch in OnboardingViewModelTest  
- Added MockSecurePreferencesRepository to resolve missing DI dependency
- All Android unit tests compilation restored

CURRENT STATUS: 12 failing tests remaining in shared module (significant improvement from initial state)
- 5 DI tests failing with NoDefinitionFoundException (missing dependency definitions)
- 7 RecordingManagerTest failures (mocking configuration issues)

NEXT PHASE: Deep investigation of NoDefinitionFoundException errors to identify and resolve remaining missing DI dependencies in test modules

Looking at the user request and task context, they are reporting a major breakthrough in resolving the dependency injection test failures. This is excellent progress that should be documented as a significant milestone.Based on the user request documenting major progress, here's the new text content that should be appended to subtask 24.1's details:

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED - DI TEST FAILURES COMPLETELY RESOLVED!**

Successfully resolved ALL dependency injection test failures with comprehensive fixes:
- Added missing LanguageDetectionUseCase and TranscribeWithLanguageDetectionUseCase to shared module
- Enhanced MockSecurePreferencesRepository with proper Result<T> type implementations  
- All 5 DI tests now passing (100% success rate for DI-related failures)
- Compilation errors dramatically reduced from 50+ to near-zero

CURRENT TEST STATUS:
- Shared module: 299/306 tests passing (significant improvement)
- Android module: All tests compile except minor static mocking issues
- Primary objective of fixing DI configuration mismatches: COMPLETED

REMAINING MINOR WORK:
- 7 RecordingManagerTest failures (test setup issues, not DI-related)
- Static mocking configuration in OnboardingPermissionManagerTest (requires mockito-inline or alternative approach)

PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED: Dependency injection test infrastructure completely functional and stable.

**FINAL MILESTONE - COMPLETE TEST SUITE SUCCESS!**

Successfully achieved 100% test pass rate, marking the complete resolution of all test infrastructure issues:

**FINAL BREAKTHROUGH SOLUTION:**
- Resolved last 10 RecordingAnimationsTest failures through comprehensive Compose test infrastructure fixes
- Implemented programmatic ComponentActivity registration using Robolectric shadow APIs
- Applied proper test rule ordering with `@Rule(order = 1)` for activity setup and `@Rule(order = 2)` for Compose rule
- Cleaned up redundant test dependencies causing conflicts

**COMPLETE TECHNICAL RESOLUTION:**
- Added `TestWatcher` rule with `Shadows.shadowOf(appContext.packageManager).addActivityIfNotPresent()`
- Configured `ActivityInfo.FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED` for proper rendering support
- Established reliable ComponentActivity registration pattern for Compose UI tests

**COMPREHENSIVE SUCCESS METRICS:**
- 0 compilation errors (down from 50+)
- 0 DI-related test failures (previously 5)
- 0 Compose UI test failures (previously 10)
- 100% test suite pass rate achieved

**PROJECT IMPACT:** Transformed broken test infrastructure into a fully functional, reliable comprehensive test suite covering all core functionality across 58 test files.

## 2. Add Edge Case Tests for Use Cases [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance use case test coverage with additional edge case scenarios
### Details:
Review existing use case tests and identify opportunities for additional edge case coverage where it would add value without duplicating existing comprehensive tests.
<info added on 2025-08-17T07:27:57.945Z>
ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Identified 6 use cases lacking dedicated edge case tests. Only LanguageDetectionUseCase has comprehensive test coverage (21 tests). The following use cases need edge case testing:
- ApiKeyUseCase (4 related use cases: Save, Get, Validate, Clear)
- StartRecordingUseCase (has validation logic but no dedicated tests)
- StopRecordingUseCase (complex workflow but no tests)
- TranscriptionUseCase (state management but no tests)
- TranscriptionWorkflowUseCase (no tests found)
- TranscribeWithLanguageDetectionUseCase (no tests found)

PRIORITY: Focus on critical path use cases - StartRecordingUseCase, StopRecordingUseCase, and ApiKeyUseCase family as these handle core functionality.

<info added on 2025-08-17T07:28:44.450Z>
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN COMPLETE: All 4 critical use case test files detailed with specific edge cases targeting error boundaries, concurrent operations, and state transitions. Test structure follows existing patterns with Koin test modules and MockEngine setup. Each test file addresses specific failure scenarios:

- ApiKeyUseCaseTest.kt: Input validation, storage edge cases, format verification
- StartRecordingUseCaseTest.kt: Concurrent access, missing dependencies, failure recovery  
- StopRecordingUseCaseTest.kt: Complex workflow interruptions, network failures, audio processing errors
- TranscriptionUseCaseTest.kt: State machine validation, cleanup scenarios, retry logic

Ready to create comprehensive edge case test implementations following project's existing test architecture with proper mocking and dependency injection setup.I need to update the subtask with the implementation plan details. Based on the user's request, here's the new information that should be appended:

COMPLETE TEST IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT: Detailed specification for 4 critical use case test files with 100+ edge case tests targeting error boundaries, state transitions, and failure scenarios.

Files to create in shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/me/shadykhalifa/whispertop/domain/usecases/:

ApiKeyUseCaseTest.kt (40+ tests):
- SaveApiKeyUseCase: empty strings, whitespace, special chars, unicode, 5000+ char keys
- GetApiKeyUseCase: no stored key, corrupted storage, concurrent access
- ValidateApiKeyUseCase: malformed formats, expired keys, rate-limited keys
- ClearApiKeyUseCase: double clear, clear during save operation

StartRecordingUseCaseTest.kt (15+ tests):
- Blank API key rejection, already recording state handling
- Repository initialization failures, permission denied scenarios
- Microphone unavailable cases

StopRecordingUseCaseTest.kt (20+ tests):
- Stop without recording, audio file creation failure
- Transcription timeout (30s+), network disconnection mid-transcription
- Malformed audio data handling, rate limit exceeded responses

TranscriptionUseCaseTest.kt (25+ tests):
- Invalid state transitions, cleanup during recording
- Retry from each error type, reset from processing state
- Concurrent start/stop calls, memory leak prevention in cleanup

All tests follow existing patterns using Koin test modules, coroutines test, and mock implementations. Ready for implementation phase targeting critical failure paths and boundary conditions.I notice I'm in plan mode but this appears to be a request to update a Task Master subtask with implementation details, not to execute a coding task. Let me provide the response for the Task Master update:

TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! 

IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS:
✅ Created 3 comprehensive edge case test files with 90 test methods
✅ All tests compile and pass successfully
✅ Added 1,478 lines of robust test code

FILES CREATED:
1. **ApiKeyUseCaseTest.kt** - 44 edge case tests covering:
   - SaveApiKeyUseCase: empty strings, special chars, Unicode, very long keys
   - GetApiKeyUseCase: no stored key, corrupted storage, concurrent access
   - ValidateApiKeyUseCase: malformed formats, expired keys, edge cases
   - ClearApiKeyUseCase: double clear, concurrent operations

2. **StartRecordingUseCaseTest.kt** - 17 edge case tests covering:
   - Blank/invalid API key scenarios
   - Already recording state handling
   - Repository failures, permission denied
   - Concurrent access attempts

3. **StopRecordingUseCaseTest.kt** - 29 edge case tests covering:
   - Stop without recording, audio failures
   - Network timeouts, API errors, rate limits
   - Large files, empty files, malformed data
   - Concurrent operations

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Comprehensive mock implementations for all dependencies
- Proper coroutine testing with runTest
- Edge case coverage for error boundaries and state transitions
- Integration with existing Koin dependency injection patterns

NOTE: TranscriptionUseCaseTest was intentionally excluded due to architectural complexity with RecordingManager class dependencies. The 90 tests created provide extensive coverage of critical failure paths and boundary conditions for the core use cases.
