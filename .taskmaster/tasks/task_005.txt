# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Audio Recording Service with WAV Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement foreground service for microphone capture and WAV file creation
# Details:
Use MediaRecorder or AudioRecord to capture audio at 16kHz mono PCM16 format as required by OpenAI API. Implement AudioRecordingService extending Service with foreground notification. Create WAV file writer with proper headers. Add recording state management (IDLE, RECORDING, PROCESSING). Implement proper cleanup and resource management. Handle audio focus and interruptions.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for WAV file format validation, integration tests for recording functionality, verify proper cleanup on service destruction

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Audio Permissions and Manifest Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure AndroidManifest.xml with required permissions and service declarations for audio recording
### Details:
Add RECORD_AUDIO, FOREGROUND_SERVICE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions to AndroidManifest.xml. Add foreground service type declarations and service component entries. Configure notification channels and required Android API permissions for audio recording functionality.

## 2. Create Core Audio Recording Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement AudioRecorder class using AudioRecord API for PCM16 audio capture at 16kHz mono
### Details:
Implement AudioRecorder class using Android AudioRecord API configured for 16kHz sample rate, mono channel, PCM16 encoding as required by OpenAI API. Create thread-safe recording operations with proper buffer management. Implement audio focus handling and interruption management for phone calls and other audio events.

Looking at the subtask context and your comprehensive update, I'll generate the new content to append to the subtask details:

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** - Successfully delivered production-ready AudioRecorder engine with full cross-platform support. Key achievements include: Clean interface design following SOLID principles with proper SRP separation. Complete Koin DI integration matching project architecture patterns. Android AudioRecorderImpl using AudioRecord API with optimal 16kHz mono PCM16 configuration for OpenAI compatibility. iOS AudioRecorderImpl using AVAudioRecorder with matching audio specifications. Thread-safe coroutine-based implementation with mutex protection and optimized buffer management using 4x multiplier and efficient ShortArray handling. Comprehensive audio focus management for call interruptions and system audio events. Robust error handling with dedicated error types and recovery mechanisms. State-driven recording management with listener pattern. Proper resource lifecycle management with automatic cleanup. Extensive test coverage including unit tests for all components, integration tests with mock implementations, and complete build validation. All tests passing with verified SOLID compliance and platform API consistency. Engine meets all OpenAI API requirements (16kHz/mono/PCM16/WAV) and integrates seamlessly with existing project infrastructure.

## 3. Implement WAV File Writer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create WAVFileWriter with proper WAV header generation and file I/O operations
### Details:
Create WAVFileWriter class that generates proper WAV headers (44-byte header for PCM16 mono format). Implement file I/O operations for writing audio data streams to WAV files. Add file management utilities for organized audio storage with proper naming and cleanup mechanisms.
<info added on 2025-08-15T19:23:44.029Z>
CRITICAL DISCOVERY: MediaRecorder saves 3GP files with .wav extension - this is incorrect. Android MediaRecorder does NOT support native WAV recording. Must switch to AudioRecord class for raw PCM data capture, then manually construct WAV headers (44-byte PCM16 mono format). Current approach is fundamentally flawed and produces invalid WAV files despite correct extension.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Successfully created optimized WAV file writer using AudioRecord for proper PCM data capture. Replaced flawed MediaRecorder approach with direct raw audio recording. Implemented efficient WAV header generation using ByteBuffer optimization. Created platform-specific Recorder implementations for Android and iOS based on whisper.cpp methodology. Added comprehensive file management utilities with proper naming and cleanup. Resolved all compilation issues and return type mismatches. All Android unit tests passing with validated WAV format compliance and accurate audio parameter calculations.

## 4. Build AudioRecordingService as Foreground Service [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Extend Android Service class implementing foreground service with recording state management
### Details:
Extend Android Service class to create AudioRecordingService with foreground notification. Integrate AudioRecorder and WAVFileWriter components. Implement recording state machine with IDLE, RECORDING, PROCESSING states. Add proper service lifecycle management and foreground service notifications.

## 5. Add Service Integration and Resource Management [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Create service communication interface and comprehensive resource management
### Details:
Create service binder interface for communication between UI components and AudioRecordingService. Implement proper cleanup procedures, resource disposal, and error handling mechanisms. Add comprehensive exception handling for recording failures, storage issues, and service lifecycle problems.

Based on the user request and task context, here is the new text content that should be appended to the subtask's details:

COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION: All service integration and resource management components have been successfully implemented and tested. AudioServiceManager provides comprehensive service binding with reactive StateFlow, automatic retry logic, and proper lifecycle management. AudioRecordingViewModel delivers complete UI coordination with combined state management and real-time updates. PermissionHandler centralizes all permission management with runtime checking and Android version compatibility. ServiceRecoveryManager implements advanced error recovery with exponential backoff and health monitoring. Full Koin DI integration completed with new androidAppModule. Comprehensive test suite includes unit tests, Android instrumentation tests, and mock validation. Production build successful with lint checks passing. All components follow SOLID principles with proper error handling, thread safety, and memory leak prevention. Service infrastructure is production-ready for UI component integration.
