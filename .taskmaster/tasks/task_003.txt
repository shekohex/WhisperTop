# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set up Project Architecture and Package Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create proper MVVM architecture with data, domain, and presentation layers. Address multiplatform compatibility issues and implement missing components.
# Details:
Create packages: data/ (repositories, local, remote, models), domain/ (usecases, repositories interfaces, models), presentation/ (ui, viewmodels, components). Replace OkHttp with Ktor for multiplatform compatibility. Implement missing repository implementations (AudioRepositoryImpl, SettingsRepositoryImpl, TranscriptionRepositoryImpl). Create data models and DTOs. Fix Koin dependency injection modules. Set up proper error handling with sealed classes for Result types. Create base classes for ViewModels and Repositories following Clean Architecture principles. Ensure successful build across all platforms (Android, iOS).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for repository interfaces and use case implementations. Verify dependency injection graph builds correctly. Test multiplatform compatibility across Android and iOS. Verify all repository implementations work correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Replace OkHttp with Ktor for multiplatform compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove OkHttp dependencies that prevent iOS compilation and implement Ktor HTTP client
### Details:
Update dependencies to use Ktor instead of OkHttp. Configure Ktor client for both Android and iOS platforms. Ensure API client functionality remains intact.

## 2. Create missing repository implementations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement AudioRepositoryImpl, SettingsRepositoryImpl, and TranscriptionRepositoryImpl
### Details:
Create concrete implementations for all repository interfaces. Implement proper error handling and data transformation. Follow Clean Architecture principles.

Analysis complete. Found that most implementations are already present but need several critical fixes:

1. SharedModule has incorrect dependency injection - singleOf(::FileReader) but FileReader is expect/actual class
2. TranscriptionRepositoryImpl has getSettings() call that can block - needs proper async handling  
3. Missing DataStore dependencies in build.gradle.kts for proper multiplatform settings persistence
4. Need to add missing platform modules to DI

All repository implementations exist and are properly structured. Platform-specific implementations for Android and iOS are complete. Main issues are around DI configuration and async handling.

<info added on 2025-08-14T23:21:45.232Z>
Repository verification complete. All implementations are present and correctly structured with proper state management, error handling, and Clean Architecture compliance. The repository layer implementation is fully complete and ready for integration with the rest of the application architecture.

## 3. Add data models and DTOs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create data layer models and DTOs for API communication
### Details:
Define data models for audio files, transcriptions, and settings. Create DTOs for API requests and responses. Implement proper serialization with kotlinx-serialization.
<info added on 2025-08-14T23:28:47.147Z>
Task 3.3 has been completed successfully. All domain models, data entities, DTOs, and serialization components have been implemented with proper Clean Architecture separation. Domain models (AudioFile, TranscriptionRequest, TranscriptionResponse) are now in separate files, data entities have @Serializable annotations for persistence, API DTOs are properly structured for request/response handling, and conversion functions between layers are implemented. The kotlinx-serialization configuration is working correctly and multiplatform compatibility is maintained throughout the data layer.

## 4. Fix Koin dependency injection modules [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete and fix the DI graph in Koin modules
### Details:
Define all necessary modules for data, domain, and presentation layers. Ensure all dependencies are properly injected. Fix any circular dependencies or missing bindings.

Looking at the task context, this appears to be a completion update for subtask 3.4 "Fix Koin dependency injection modules" which was marked as in-progress and is now being reported as completed successfully.

The user's request contains a comprehensive completion report detailing:
1. The fundamental design flaw that was fixed (SOLID principle violations)
2. The proper SOLID design implementation 
3. Complete architectural refactor details
4. Comprehensive testing suite results
5. Full verification with all tests passing
6. Key benefits achieved

This is a substantial completion update that should be appended to the subtask's implementation details to document what was accomplished.Based on the task context and user request, I can see this is a completion update for subtask 3.4 "Fix Koin dependency injection modules." The user is providing a comprehensive report of successful completion.

The new text content that should be appended to the subtask's details is:

**COMPLETION UPDATE:** Task 3.4 completed successfully with a SOLID-compliant dependency injection solution! Fixed fundamental DI design flaw where repositories depended directly on expect/actual classes, violating SOLID principles and making testing impossible. Implemented proper SOLID design with service interfaces (AudioRecorderService, FileReaderService) applying Dependency Inversion Principle. Repositories now depend on abstractions, not concretions. Created adapter pattern with service implementations bridging between domain interfaces and platform-specific expect/actual classes. Complete architectural refactor across domain layer (service interfaces), data layer (service adapters), repository layer (updated dependencies), and DI configuration (proper binding). Comprehensive testing suite implemented with mock services and 7 passing DI test scenarios. Full verification achieved: all tests pass (7/7), successful Android and iOS builds, proper mock injection, clean architecture maintained. Key benefits: testable with mockable dependencies, SOLID compliant following Dependency Inversion Principle, maintainable with clean separation, multiplatform compatible, and flexible for easy implementation swapping.I understand you want me to update subtask 3.4 with the completion details you've provided. Let me present my plan:I see you want to update subtask 3.4 with completion details. Since I'm in plan mode, I cannot execute the updates yet. Here's what I would do:

**Plan:**
1. Update subtask 3.4 implementation details with the completion report you provided
2. Change subtask 3.4 status from "in-progress" to "done"

The completion report documents successful implementation of a SOLID-compliant dependency injection solution with proper architectural design, comprehensive testing, and multiplatform verification.

Would you like me to proceed with this update?

## 5. Verify multiplatform build compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure successful build across all target platforms
### Details:
Test builds on Android and iOS. Fix any platform-specific compilation issues. Ensure all dependencies are multiplatform compatible.
<info added on 2025-08-14T23:09:37.436Z>
BUILD SUCCESSFULLY FIXED! All compilation issues resolved across Android and iOS platforms.

**Fixed Issues:**
- expect/actual constructor mismatch: Replaced PreferencesDataSourceImpl class pattern with factory function pattern (createPreferencesDataSource()) to properly handle Android Context dependency
- iOS AudioRecorder errors: Fixed NSDate time handling, ExperimentalForeignApi annotations, and audio format constants  
- iOS FileReader issues: Added proper ExperimentalForeignApi annotations for CInterop usage
- DI configuration: Updated Koin modules to use new factory pattern

**Build Verification Results:**
- Android compilation (Debug & Release): PASSED
- iOS compilation (Arm64, X64, SimulatorArm64): PASSED  
- All test compilations: PASSED
- Framework linking for iOS: PASSED
- Multiplatform build compatibility: VERIFIED

Note: expect/actual Beta warnings are expected for KMP projects and non-blocking. Build now compiles successfully across all target platforms.
