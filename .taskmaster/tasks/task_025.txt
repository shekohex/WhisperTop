Based on the user request and task context, here is the new information that should be appended to the subtask details:

Starting implementation with research findings: kotlinx.serialization automatically includes ProGuard rules since v1.5.0, but named companion objects require special handling. Koin basic DI doesn't need special ProGuard rules, though reflection features may require additional rules. Creating comprehensive proguard-rules.pro with keep rules for Ktor client classes, Koin dependency injection (with reflection support), Kotlinx Serialization (including companion object handling), AndroidX Security crypto classes, and Compose UI components to ensure proper release build functionality.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! Created comprehensive proguard-rules.pro with 330+ lines covering Kotlinx Serialization (21 @Serializable classes protected), Ktor Client 3.0.3 with OkHttp (including debug detection fix), Koin 4.0.2 dependency injection, AndroidX Security Crypto & Work Manager, Compose UI & Navigation, Android Services (overlay, accessibility), and aggressive optimization settings. Updated composeApp/build.gradle.kts enabling minifyEnabled=true & isShrinkResources=true, added proguard-android-optimize.txt, configured BuildConfig fields for debugging, and set up debug vs release build variants. Created shared/consumer-rules.pro for library module. RESULTS: Debug APK 22M (baseline), Release APK 6.8M (69% reduction!), all tests passing (551 tests), mapping file generated (55M) for crash debugging, both debug and release builds successful. VERIFICATION: ./gradlew assembleDebug SUCCESS, ./gradlew assembleRelease SUCCESS, ./gradlew test SUCCESS (551 tests passed). Production readiness significantly improved with major APK size reduction and code obfuscation.

Based on the user request to mark this subtask as cancelled and the reasoning provided, here is the new text that should be appended to the subtask details:

CANCELLED for current release. SSL certificate pinning is a good security practice but not essential for initial release. Can be implemented in future versions for enhanced security against man-in-the-middle attacks when communicating with OpenAI API. Current HTTPS + TLS provides adequate security for MVP release.

## 3. Integrate Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting and analytics [cancelled]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive crash reporting with Firebase Crashlytics integration
### Details:
Add Firebase Crashlytics SDK to build.gradle.kts dependencies. Create CrashReportingManager with proper privacy controls and user consent handling. Implement custom crash reporting for recording errors and API failures. Add crash-free user reporting and performance monitoring. Configure Crashlytics to respect user privacy settings and provide opt-out mechanism. Integrate with existing error handling in TranscriptionRepository and AudioRecordingService.
<info added on 2025-08-17T11:54:37.633Z>
Cancellation rationale: Requires Firebase project setup which will be handled manually later. Firebase Crashlytics integration should be implemented after Firebase project is configured with google-services.json. This is important for production crash reporting and analytics but not blocking for initial release. Task deferred to post-Firebase setup phase.

## 4. Add performance monitoring with LeakCanary and metrics collection [cancelled]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement memory leak detection and performance monitoring for production readiness
### Details:
Integrate LeakCanary for debug builds with custom leak detection rules for Services and ViewModels. Create PerformanceMonitor class to track app startup time, memory usage, and API response times. Add memory leak detection for OverlayService and AudioRecordingService lifecycle. Implement performance metrics collection for recording workflows and OpenAI API calls. Add battery usage monitoring and optimization detection.
<info added on 2025-08-17T11:55:49.236Z>
Looking at the user request, they want to update subtask 25.4 to document why it was cancelled and note its potential future value. The update should explain that while LeakCanary and performance monitoring are valuable tools, they're not essential for the MVP release and can be deferred.

Based on the context provided, here's the new text that should be appended to the subtask's details:

Cancelled for current release cycle. LeakCanary and performance monitoring are valuable for debugging and detecting memory leaks, especially with overlay services and background operations, but not essential for initial MVP release. Can be added later for enhanced debugging and performance optimization.

Configure build variants for different deployment targets (Play Store, sideload). Add version code auto-increment and version name management. Configure APK splitting by ABI and density. Add build timestamp and commit hash to BuildConfig for debugging.
<info added on 2025-08-17T11:57:47.754Z>
I'll analyze the current build configuration and provide the update content for subtask 25.5.Progress update: Analyzed current build configuration and identified missing components from user requirements. Current composeApp/build.gradle.kts has basic release settings but lacks version code auto-increment, APK splitting, proper signing configuration with environment variables, and enhanced build variants. Need to implement Git-based version code generation, ABI/density splitting configuration, environment-variable-driven signing configs, and product flavors for Play Store vs sideload deployment targets. Will add enhanced BuildConfig fields with Git commit hash and properly formatted build timestamps.
</info added on 2025-08-17T11:57:47.754Z>
<info added on 2025-08-17T12:01:45.570Z>
Implementation completed successfully with comprehensive production-ready build configuration. All build variants now support environment-driven signing, automatic version management, APK optimization with ABI splitting, and enhanced BuildConfig fields. Verification shows successful builds for all combinations (playstore/sideload Ã— debug/release). Production deployment system ready with proper distribution channel tracking and analytics control.

Configure bundle optimization for reduced download size.
<info added on 2025-08-17T12:06:21.485Z>
Cancelled for current release. Advanced APK size and startup performance optimizations are nice-to-have improvements but not critical for MVP functionality. The basic ProGuard/R8 optimization (subtask 25.1) already achieved significant APK size reduction (69%). Additional optimizations like WebP conversion, aggressive shrinking, and startup time measurement can be implemented in future versions for enhanced performance.
