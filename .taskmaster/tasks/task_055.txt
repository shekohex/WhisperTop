# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 54, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive permissions dashboard UI with Material 3 design showing permission cards in grid/list layout with visual status indicators, action buttons, and educational tooltips.
# Details:
Create PermissionsDashboardScreen composable with LazyVerticalGrid layout using adaptive columns for different screen sizes. Implement PermissionCard composable with Material 3 Card design containing permission icon, title, description, and status indicator (green checkmark for granted, amber warning triangle for denied). Add PermissionStatusBadge with animated state transitions using AnimatedContent. Create ActionButton composable for one-tap system settings navigation using Intent.ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS. Implement InfoTooltip composable with Material 3 TooltipBox explaining permission necessity. Add PermissionPriority enum (Critical, Optional) with visual distinction using different card borders and colors. Create RefreshButton with pull-to-refresh functionality using SwipeRefresh. Implement FirstTimeUserFlow with educational overlay using Material 3 BottomSheet showing permission importance. Add accessibility support with proper contentDescription, semantics, and TalkBack announcements. Implement state change animations using AnimatedVisibility and spring animations. Create PermissionCategory sections (Audio, System, Accessibility) with collapsible headers. Add permission request flow integration calling PermissionsViewModel.requestPermission() methods.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for PermissionsDashboardScreen composition with mock PermissionsViewModel verifying correct permission states display and card rendering. Test permission status indicator updates using ComposeTestRule and verify color changes for granted/denied states. UI tests for one-tap action buttons ensuring proper Intent launching to system settings. Test tooltip display and dismissal behavior with touch interactions. Verify grid layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes and orientations. Test pull-to-refresh gesture and state updates. Accessibility testing with TalkBack enabled verifying proper content descriptions and navigation. Test first-time user educational flow completion and dismissal. Integration tests with PermissionsViewModel for real-time permission state updates.
