# Task ID: 34
# Title: Fix Accessibility Service Text Insertion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 11, 32, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Accessibility service fails to paste transcribed text into focused text fields. Critical functionality completely broken.
# Details:
Critical bug: Text insertion doesn't work at all. Need to: 1) Verify accessibility service is properly enabled 2) Check focus detection logic 3) Fix text insertion method 4) Handle different input field types 5) Test across various apps. Could be related to transcription bugs if no text is being generated.

# Test Strategy:
Test on emulator: 1) Enable accessibility service 2) Open any app with text field 3) Focus on field 4) Trigger recording 5) Verify text appears 6) Test in Chrome, Messages, Notes apps

# Subtasks:
## 1. Diagnose Accessibility Service Status [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify accessibility service is running and receiving events
