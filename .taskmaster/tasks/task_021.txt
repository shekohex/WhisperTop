# Task ID: 21
# Title: Add Battery Optimization Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement battery optimization exemption requests and background service management
# Details:
Detect battery optimization settings and request exemption when needed. Implement proper foreground service handling with persistent notifications. Add doze mode handling and background processing optimization. Create user education about battery settings. Implement service restart mechanisms after system kills. Add power management best practices.

# Test Strategy:
Test background service persistence, verify battery optimization detection, test service restart mechanisms

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Battery Optimization Detection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create utility class to detect current battery optimization status and provide user feedback
### Details:
Implement BatteryOptimizationUtil class using PowerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations() to check if the app is whitelisted from battery optimization. Create UI components to display current status in settings screen. Add proper permission checks for BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_IGNORED. Implement status indicators showing whether battery optimization is enabled/disabled for the app.

## 2. Create Battery Optimization Exemption Request Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement user-friendly flow to request battery optimization exemption
### Details:
Create intent-based flow using ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS to prompt user to whitelist the app. Design user education dialog explaining why battery optimization exemption is needed for continuous audio recording. Implement proper permission handling for REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS. Add fallback flow directing users to manual settings if direct request fails. Create onboarding flow that guides users through this process during first setup.

## 3. Implement Foreground Service with Persistent Notification [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Create proper foreground service implementation for audio recording with required persistent notifications
### Details:
Extend Service class to create AudioRecordingService with proper foreground service lifecycle. Implement persistent notification with recording status, start/stop controls, and proper notification channel configuration. Add notification actions for pause/resume recording. Handle service promotion to foreground during recording sessions. Implement proper cleanup when service is stopped. Add notification importance and behavior configuration for minimal user disruption.

## 4. Add Doze Mode and Background Processing Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Implement doze mode handling and optimize background processing for power efficiency
### Details:
Implement DeviceIdleController integration to handle doze mode transitions. Add wake lock management for critical audio processing periods with minimal duration. Implement intelligent batching of API requests when possible. Add app standby handling and optimize background tasks to work within Android's power management constraints. Create power-aware scheduling for non-critical operations. Implement proper handling of network restrictions during doze mode.

## 5. Create Service Restart and Recovery Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Implement automatic service restart mechanisms and recovery strategies after system kills
### Details:
Implement service restart logic using START_STICKY return type and proper restart handling. Create BroadcastReceiver for system events (boot completed, power connected) to restart service when appropriate. Implement job scheduler for periodic service health checks and automatic restart. Add crash recovery mechanisms with state preservation. Create power management best practices documentation and implement proper service lifecycle management. Add monitoring for service health and automatic restart triggers.
