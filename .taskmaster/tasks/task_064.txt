# Task ID: 64
# Title: Create Comprehensive Documentation and Migration Guide
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop complete technical documentation covering database schema, UI components, architecture, API documentation, user guides, performance benchmarks, testing strategy, accessibility compliance, and release notes with KDoc integration.
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation structure including: 1) Database schema documentation with migration scripts for data model changes and upgrade paths between versions. 2) UI component documentation using KDoc for all Compose components, including usage examples, parameter descriptions, and visual previews. 3) ViewModel architecture documentation explaining data flow patterns, state management, and dependency injection. 4) API documentation for all repository interfaces and implementations with request/response examples. 5) User guide covering new features, setup instructions, troubleshooting, and FAQ. 6) Performance benchmarks documenting recording latency, transcription speed, memory usage, and optimization recommendations. 7) Testing strategy documentation with coverage reports, test types (unit, integration, UI), and testing best practices. 8) Accessibility compliance checklist covering screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and WCAG guidelines. 9) Release notes for users highlighting new features, bug fixes, breaking changes, and migration steps. 10) Update existing README files with new architecture diagrams and setup instructions. 11) Add inline KDoc comments for complex business logic, algorithms, and architectural patterns. 12) Create migration scripts for settings, preferences, and data format changes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation completeness by reviewing all public APIs have KDoc comments. Test migration scripts on sample data to ensure smooth upgrades. Validate all code examples in documentation compile and run correctly. Review user guide with beta testers for clarity and completeness. Run accessibility audit tools against documented compliance checklist. Verify performance benchmarks are reproducible and accurate. Test documentation generation pipeline and ensure all formats (HTML, PDF) render correctly. Validate API documentation matches actual implementation signatures.
