# Task ID: 61
# Title: Create Comprehensive Test Suite for New Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 10, 12, 16, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop extensive test coverage across all layers including unit tests for business logic, UI tests for components, integration tests for workflows, and performance/accessibility testing.
# Details:
Create comprehensive test suite with 80% code coverage targeting all new features: 1) Unit tests for statistics calculations, WPM conversion algorithms, and mathematical operations with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers, overflow scenarios). 2) Database operation tests covering CRUD operations, search functionality, pagination logic, transaction handling, and database migration scenarios using Room testing utilities. 3) ViewModel tests with MockK for repository mocking, testing StateFlow emissions, error state handling, and lifecycle-aware behavior. 4) Compose UI tests for dashboard components using ComposeTestRule, testing user interactions, state changes, navigation flows, and Material 3 theming. 5) Integration tests for complete navigation flows between screens, testing deep links, back stack management, and cross-screen data passing. 6) Instrumented tests for Android-specific permission handling, overlay service functionality, accessibility service integration, and system-level interactions. 7) Performance tests using Android Benchmark library for large dataset operations, memory usage monitoring, and rendering performance. 8) Accessibility tests with Espresso for screen reader compatibility, focus management, content descriptions, and semantic properties. Implement custom test utilities, fixtures, and mock data generators. Configure test reporting with coverage analysis and continuous integration support.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test suite achieves minimum 80% code coverage using JaCoCo reports. Run unit tests in isolation to ensure fast feedback loops. Execute UI tests on multiple device configurations and API levels. Validate instrumented tests on physical devices with different Android versions. Perform accessibility testing with TalkBack enabled. Run performance benchmarks on low-end devices to ensure acceptable performance thresholds. Create test documentation with examples and best practices. Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline with failure notifications and coverage reporting.
