# Task ID: 60
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 48, 10, 42, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive performance optimization layer with LRU caching, database query optimization, memory management, and background processing for improved app responsiveness and reduced resource usage.
# Details:
Implement PerformanceCacheManager with LRU cache using LinkedHashMap for recent transcriptions (max 50 items, 24-hour TTL). Create StatisticsCacheService with cache invalidation on data changes using Flow-based reactive updates. Implement LazyHistoryLoader for paginated history with RecyclerView ViewHolder recycling and image loading optimization using Coil with memory caching. Add DatabaseOptimizer with Room indexes on frequently queried columns (timestamp, status, user_id), connection pooling, and prepared statement caching. Create BackgroundThreadManager using Kotlin coroutines with custom dispatchers for CPU-intensive operations (IO dispatcher for database, Default for calculations). Implement MemoryProfiler using Android's Debug.MemoryInfo for leak detection and WeakReference cleanup. Add PerformanceMonitor with frame rate tracking (Choreographer.FrameCallback), operation timing using System.nanoTime(), and memory usage monitoring. Create cache eviction policies with size-based (memory pressure), time-based (TTL), and event-based (data changes) triggers. Implement proper coroutine scope management with structured concurrency and cancellation support.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for LRU cache operations (insert, evict, TTL expiration) and statistics cache invalidation scenarios. Implement integration tests for database query performance using large datasets and verify index effectiveness with EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN. Test memory leak detection with LeakCanary integration and validate WeakReference cleanup. Create performance benchmark tests measuring dashboard load time (<500ms), history search time (<100ms), and UI frame rate (target 60fps). Test background thread management with concurrent operations and verify proper coroutine cancellation. Implement cache stress testing with memory pressure simulation and validate eviction policies. Test lazy loading behavior with RecyclerView scroll performance and image loading optimization.
