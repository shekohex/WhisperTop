Fixed fundamental DI design flaw where repositories depended directly on expect/actual classes, violating SOLID principles and making testing impossible. Implemented proper SOLID design with service interfaces (AudioRecorderService, FileReaderService) applying Dependency Inversion Principle. Repositories now depend on abstractions, not concretions. Created adapter pattern with service implementations bridging between domain interfaces and platform-specific expect/actual classes. Complete architectural refactor across domain layer (service interfaces), data layer (service adapters), repository layer (updated dependencies), and DI configuration (proper binding). Comprehensive testing suite implemented with mock services and 7 passing DI test scenarios. Full verification achieved: all tests pass (7/7), successful Android and iOS builds, proper mock injection, clean architecture maintained. Key benefits: testable with mockable dependencies, SOLID compliant following Dependency Inversion Principle, maintainable with clean separation, multiplatform compatible, and flexible for easy implementation swapping.I understand you want me to update subtask 3.4 with the completion details you've provided.

AudioSource.MIC applies automatic noise suppression that may be too aggressive\n2. Default noise reduction is enabled (QualityPreset.MEDIUM)\n3. Noise gate threshold set to 0.5% amplitude may be filtering out quiet speech\n4. No audio gain amplification implemented\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n1. Switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION audio source to bypass aggressive processing\n2. Disable noise reduction for initial testing\n3. Lower or disable noise gate threshold\n4. Implement configurable gain amplification for low-volume environments\n\nThese findings will guide the implementation in the next subtask to remove/optimize noise suppression settings.Analysis completed successfully. The investigation revealed several issues with the current AudioRecord configuration that explain the low audio levels:\n\n**Current Configuration Found:**\n- AudioSource: MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC (line 256) - may have aggressive noise suppression\n- Sample Rate: 16kHz (correct for Whisper API)\n- Channel: MONO (correct)\n- Format: PCM_16BIT (correct)\n- Buffer: 4x minimum buffer size (adequate)\n\n**Root Causes Identified:**\n1. **AudioSource.MIC** applies system-level noise suppression that may be too aggressive for quiet speech\n2. **Noise reduction enabled** by default (QualityPreset.MEDIUM, line 50) further reduces audio levels\n3. **Noise gate threshold** set to 0.5% amplitude (line 64) may filter out legitimate quiet speech\n4. **No gain amplification** implemented to boost low-volume recordings\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n1. Switch to **VOICE_RECOGNITION** audio source for less processing\n2. **Disable noise reduction** initially for testing\n3. **Lower or disable noise gate** threshold\n4. **Add configurable gain amplification** for quiet environments\n\nThe analysis is complete and provides clear direction for the next subtask to implement these optimizations.Based on the analysis provided, I understand you want to update subtask 33.1 with the findings from your audio configuration investigation. The analysis has successfully identified the root causes of the low audio recording levels.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Current AudioSource.MIC may be applying excessive noise suppression\n- Default noise reduction and aggressive noise gate threshold are reducing audio levels\n- No gain amplification is currently implemented\n- The recommendation is to switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION source and optimize noise processing\n\nThis analysis provides a clear foundation for moving forward with subtask 33.2 to implement the noise suppression optimizations.I understand you want to update the subtask with your analysis findings. Your investigation has successfully identified the root causes of the audio recording quality issues in the WhisperTop application.\n\nThe analysis shows that the current AudioRecord configuration uses AudioSource.MIC with enabled noise reduction and an aggressive noise gate threshold, which together are causing the low audio levels that result in failed transcriptions.\n\nYour recommended solutions to switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION audio source, disable noise reduction, adjust the noise gate, and add gain amplification provide a clear path forward for fixing these issues.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with updating subtask 33.1 in Task Master with these analysis results?\n</info added on 2025-08-18T00:07:58.280Z>",

PHASE 2 - Implement State Mapping Layer: Create WorkflowState.toUiState() extension function to transform domain WorkflowState to clean AudioRecordingUiState. Implement domain model to presentation model mappers (AudioFile → AudioFilePresentationModel, TranscriptionResult → TranscriptionDisplayModel). Add error message transformation from domain errors to user-friendly display messages. PHASE 3 - Refactor AudioRecordingViewModel: Remove 5 infrastructure dependencies (AudioServiceManager, PermissionHandler, SettingsRepository, TextInsertionService, Context), keep only TranscriptionWorkflowUseCase. Replace complex state combination logic (lines 386-398) with single workflowState.collect transformation. Move all business logic (100+ lines) from ViewModel to appropriate domain use cases. Reduce ViewModel from 398 lines to approximately 100 lines focusing purely on UI state management. PHASE 4 - Create Missing Domain Use Cases: Implement ServiceManagementUseCase to handle service binding, connection state, and permission management abstractly.

Create proper domain events for state transitions instead of direct UI state manipulation.",

        "title": "Fix Multiplatform Architecture Build Issues and Platform Code Separation",
        "description": "Resolve compilation failures by properly separating Android-specific code from commonMain source set, creating expect/actual declarations, and implementing missing repository classes to enable clean builds in the multiplatform structure.",
        "details": "## Critical Issues Identified:\n\n### 1. Room Database Code in commonMain (Lines 3-5 in TranscriptionHistoryEntity.kt)\n- **Move to androidMain**: TranscriptionHistoryEntity.kt, UserStatisticsEntity.kt, DatabaseConverters.kt\n- **Create expect/actual pattern**: Define data interfaces in commonMain, implement Room entities in androidMain\n- **Update mappers**: TranscriptionHistoryMapper.kt to work with platform abstractions\n\n### 2. AndroidX Paging in commonMain (Lines 3-4 in TranscriptionHistoryPagingSource.kt)\n- **Move PagingSource**: TranscriptionHistoryPagingSource.kt to androidMain\n- **Create abstractions**: Define platform-agnostic pagination interfaces in commonMain\n- **Update repositories**: Make TranscriptionHistoryRepository platform-agnostic\n\n### 3. Java-Specific APIs in commonMain (Lines 61-63 in RetryService.kt)\n- **Replace Java exceptions**: java.net.SocketTimeoutException, java.net.UnknownHostException, java.io.IOException with KMP alternatives\n- **Create expect/actual**: For platform-specific exception handling\n\n### 4. JVM-Specific Synchronization (Lines 67, 119, 142 in ErrorLoggingService.kt)\n- **Replace synchronized blocks**: Use Kotlin Multiplatform Mutex from kotlinx.coroutines.sync\n- **Update thread safety**: Implement proper concurrent data structures\n\n### 5. SecurityException Usage (ErrorClassification.kt)\n- **Create expect/actual**: For SecurityException handling across platforms\n- **Platform abstractions**: Define common error types in commonMain\n\n### 6. Missing Repository Implementations\n- **Implement**: TranscriptionHistoryRepositoryImpl, UserStatisticsRepositoryImpl in data layer\n- **Dependency injection**: Update SharedModule to properly separate platform-specific dependencies\n- **Database setup**: Create proper Room database initialization in androidMain\n\n### 7. Audio Recorder Platform Separation\n- **Move implementations**: Android-specific MediaRecorder usage to androidMain\n- **Create abstractions**: Audio recording interfaces in commonMain with Android actual implementations\n\n### 8. SettingsViewModel Issues\n- **Fix byte array conversion**: Handle platform-specific serialization properly\n- **Update preferences**: Ensure multiplatform compatibility for secure storage\n\n## Implementation Steps:\n1. Create expect declarations in commonMain for all platform-specific APIs\n2. Move Android-specific implementations to androidMain as actual implementations\n3. Update dependency injection to properly separate concerns\n4. Implement missing repository classes with proper multiplatform structure\n5. Replace Java-specific APIs with Kotlin Multiplatform alternatives\n6. Update all import statements and references\n7. Test compilation on both Android and potential iOS targets",
        "testStrategy": "Verify successful compilation with './gradlew build' and './gradlew compileDebugKotlinAndroid'. Test that commonMain contains no platform-specific code by attempting to compile against iOS target if configured. Run existing unit tests to ensure functionality is preserved. Verify dependency injection works correctly across platform boundaries. Test that Room database operations work correctly through the new abstractions. Validate that audio recording, transcription workflows, and settings management continue to work properly after the architectural changes.",
