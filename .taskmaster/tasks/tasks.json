Fixed fundamental DI design flaw where repositories depended directly on expect/actual classes, violating SOLID principles and making testing impossible. Implemented proper SOLID design with service interfaces (AudioRecorderService, FileReaderService) applying Dependency Inversion Principle. Repositories now depend on abstractions, not concretions. Created adapter pattern with service implementations bridging between domain interfaces and platform-specific expect/actual classes. Complete architectural refactor across domain layer (service interfaces), data layer (service adapters), repository layer (updated dependencies), and DI configuration (proper binding). Comprehensive testing suite implemented with mock services and 7 passing DI test scenarios. Full verification achieved: all tests pass (7/7), successful Android and iOS builds, proper mock injection, clean architecture maintained. Key benefits: testable with mockable dependencies, SOLID compliant following Dependency Inversion Principle, maintainable with clean separation, multiplatform compatible, and flexible for easy implementation swapping.I understand you want me to update subtask 3.4 with the completion details you've provided.

AudioSource.MIC applies automatic noise suppression that may be too aggressive\n2. Default noise reduction is enabled (QualityPreset.MEDIUM)\n3. Noise gate threshold set to 0.5% amplitude may be filtering out quiet speech\n4. No audio gain amplification implemented\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n1. Switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION audio source to bypass aggressive processing\n2. Disable noise reduction for initial testing\n3. Lower or disable noise gate threshold\n4. Implement configurable gain amplification for low-volume environments\n\nThese findings will guide the implementation in the next subtask to remove/optimize noise suppression settings.Analysis completed successfully. The investigation revealed several issues with the current AudioRecord configuration that explain the low audio levels:\n\n**Current Configuration Found:**\n- AudioSource: MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC (line 256) - may have aggressive noise suppression\n- Sample Rate: 16kHz (correct for Whisper API)\n- Channel: MONO (correct)\n- Format: PCM_16BIT (correct)\n- Buffer: 4x minimum buffer size (adequate)\n\n**Root Causes Identified:**\n1. **AudioSource.MIC** applies system-level noise suppression that may be too aggressive for quiet speech\n2. **Noise reduction enabled** by default (QualityPreset.MEDIUM, line 50) further reduces audio levels\n3. **Noise gate threshold** set to 0.5% amplitude (line 64) may filter out legitimate quiet speech\n4. **No gain amplification** implemented to boost low-volume recordings\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n1. Switch to **VOICE_RECOGNITION** audio source for less processing\n2. **Disable noise reduction** initially for testing\n3. **Lower or disable noise gate** threshold\n4. **Add configurable gain amplification** for quiet environments\n\nThe analysis is complete and provides clear direction for the next subtask to implement these optimizations.Based on the analysis provided, I understand you want to update subtask 33.1 with the findings from your audio configuration investigation. The analysis has successfully identified the root causes of the low audio recording levels.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Current AudioSource.MIC may be applying excessive noise suppression\n- Default noise reduction and aggressive noise gate threshold are reducing audio levels\n- No gain amplification is currently implemented\n- The recommendation is to switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION source and optimize noise processing\n\nThis analysis provides a clear foundation for moving forward with subtask 33.2 to implement the noise suppression optimizations.I understand you want to update the subtask with your analysis findings. Your investigation has successfully identified the root causes of the audio recording quality issues in the WhisperTop application.\n\nThe analysis shows that the current AudioRecord configuration uses AudioSource.MIC with enabled noise reduction and an aggressive noise gate threshold, which together are causing the low audio levels that result in failed transcriptions.\n\nYour recommended solutions to switch to VOICE_RECOGNITION audio source, disable noise reduction, adjust the noise gate, and add gain amplification provide a clear path forward for fixing these issues.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with updating subtask 33.1 in Task Master with these analysis results?\n</info added on 2025-08-18T00:07:58.280Z>",

Create reference audio files for testing.\n<info added on 2025-08-18T00:13:37.292Z>\nLooking at the context provided, I need to generate the text content that should be appended to subtask 33.5's details based on the user's completion report.\n\nThe user has provided a comprehensive implementation report showing that the audio level monitoring and testing features have been successfully completed. Based on this report, here is the text that should be appended to the subtask's details:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - Audio level monitoring and testing system fully implemented with comprehensive validation methods. Added isAudioLevelAcceptable() method with RMS > 2%, dB > -50dB, and average level > 1% thresholds. Created logAudioDiagnostics() method for real-time debug logging with quality scores and recommendations. Enhanced AudioRecordingThread with periodic level logging every 5 seconds. Added testAudioLevelValidation() integration test verifying real audio recording, level validation, WAV file creation, and diagnostic logging. Successfully leveraged existing AudioQualityManager infrastructure including AudioMetrics for RMS/peak/dB calculations, RecordingStatistics for duration/size/silence tracking, and QualityReport for issue identification. System now provides complete audio monitoring capabilities to diagnose and resolve low volume transcription issues.\n</info added on 2025-08-18T00:13:37.292Z>",
