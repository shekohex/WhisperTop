Fixed fundamental DI design flaw where repositories depended directly on expect/actual classes, violating SOLID principles and making testing impossible. Implemented proper SOLID design with service interfaces (AudioRecorderService, FileReaderService) applying Dependency Inversion Principle. Repositories now depend on abstractions, not concretions. Created adapter pattern with service implementations bridging between domain interfaces and platform-specific expect/actual classes. Complete architectural refactor across domain layer (service interfaces), data layer (service adapters), repository layer (updated dependencies), and DI configuration (proper binding). Comprehensive testing suite implemented with mock services and 7 passing DI test scenarios. Full verification achieved: all tests pass (7/7), successful Android and iOS builds, proper mock injection, clean architecture maintained. Key benefits: testable with mockable dependencies, SOLID compliant following Dependency Inversion Principle, maintainable with clean separation, multiplatform compatible, and flexible for easy implementation swapping.I understand you want me to update subtask 3.4 with the completion details you've provided.

The default `AppSettings.apiKey` is empty (\"\"), which triggers validation error 'API Key cannot be empty' on initial load. Validation also triggers on every keystroke via `onValueChange = onApiKeyChange` in `SettingsScreen.kt:174`, preventing users from typing 's', 'sk', 'sk-' without seeing errors.\n\n**Current Problematic Logic:**\n```kotlin\nval validationError = when {\n    apiKey.isBlank() -> \"API Key cannot be empty\"\n    !apiKey.startsWith(\"sk-\") -> \"Invalid API key format. OpenAI API keys start with 'sk-'\"\n    apiKey.length < 40 -> \"API key is too short. OpenAI API keys are typically 51 characters long\"\n    else -> null\n}\n```\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1.
