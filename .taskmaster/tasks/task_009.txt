# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement draggable floating mic button with state indicators
# Details:
Create MicButtonOverlay using Jetpack Compose in overlay window. Implement draggable behavior with touch event handling and screen edge snapping. Add state-based visual indicators: gray (idle), red (recording), blue (processing). Implement animated pulsing ring during recording. Add haptic feedback for state changes. Support different screen sizes and orientations.

# Test Strategy:
Test dragging behavior across screen, verify state animations work correctly, test on different screen sizes
