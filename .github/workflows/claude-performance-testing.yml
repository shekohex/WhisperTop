            This PR contains changes that could affect WhisperTop performance. Please:
            
            **1. Build and Test Analysis:**
            - Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` and analyze build time
            - Run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` for unit tests
            - Run `./gradlew lint` and check for performance warnings
            - Check for any build failures or warnings
            
            **2. Performance-Critical Code Review:**
            - Audio recording and processing efficiency
            - OpenAI API call optimization and error handling
            - Service lifecycle and memory management
            - Overlay rendering performance
            - Koin DI setup and injection performance
            - Coroutines usage and thread management
            
            **3. Memory and Resource Analysis:**
            - Look for potential memory leaks in services
            - Check for proper resource cleanup (audio streams, HTTP clients)
            - Analyze Compose recomposition efficiency
            - Review background task scheduling
            
            **4. Android-Specific Performance:**
            - Service startup time optimization
            - Accessibility service response time
            - Overlay window performance
            - Audio capture latency
            - API key storage/retrieval efficiency
            
            **5. Recommendations:**
            - Suggest performance improvements if any issues found
            - Recommend profiling areas if needed
            - Point out any potential bottlenecks
            
            Focus on real-world performance impact for the WhisperTop use case.
